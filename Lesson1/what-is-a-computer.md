Fundamentally, a computer, like its name suggests, is a computational device. It is designed to **take in** some information, **perform some computation** on that information, and produce some **output**. These functions, neatly categorized into **INPUT**, **PROCESS** and **OUTPUT**, define the nature of any computer, regardless of its size, form or industry.

Any device worthy of the name, computer, must be capable of performing these functions. In fact, you can say any device that has these 3 functions is a computer.
