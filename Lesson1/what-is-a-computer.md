# 1. What is a Computer?

| CONCEPT | A Computer is a computational device, designed specifically so that it can follow instructions to accomplish tasks. |
| --- | ----------- |

Fundamentally, a computer, like its name suggests, is a computational device. It is designed to **take in** some information, **perform some computation** on that information, and produce some **output**. These functions, neatly categorized into **INPUT**, **PROCESS** and **OUTPUT**, define the nature of any computer, regardless of its size, form or industry.

Any device worthy of the name, computer, must be capable of performing these functions. In fact, you can say any device that has these 3 functions is a computer.

## 1.1 The Computing System

To think of a computer as a device is really a misnomer, because your computer is actually a system of devices, each with a very specific role geared towards one or more of the 3 functions described above.  

Every computer you have ever used, or you are using right now to read this text, comprises of **hardware** and **software**.

### 1.1.1 Hardware

Computer hardware are the physical components of the computing system. A typical computer, like the one you are using right now, has 10s of hardware components. These components can be categorized into; **input devices**, **processing devices** and **output devices**:

1. **Input Devices**
    
    **Input** is any information or data you enter into your computer. As such, any physical device you use in the process of entering data into your computer is an input device. In modern computing systems, you will interact with these often.

    Common input devices are:
    | Keyboard | Camera | Graphic Tablet | Webcam | Mouse | Microphone |
