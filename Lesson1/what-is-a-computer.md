Fundamentally, a computer, like its name suggests, is a computational device. It is designed to **take in** some information, **perform some computation** on that information, and produce some **output**. These functions, neatly categorized into **INPUT**, **PROCESS** and **OUTPUT**, define the nature of any computer, regardless of its size, form or industry.
